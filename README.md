## jlox
This is my take on the jlox interpreter from [Crafting Compilers](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.  
Right now it is a work in progress as I go through the book, so it is going to
follow the book pretty closely. I *have* been trying to add Javadoc comments
as I go along. As I get further along I may play around with some parts and try
different strategies to achieve some of the goals or extend the language in
some interesting way.

I am doing this as part of the build up to my thesis at Carthage College.

### Development Notes
I am currently developing jlox in IntelliJ 2023.2.2 targeting Java 21 with the
OpenJDK 21 runtime.
